# 💬 AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis for ChatGPT Reviews

## 📘 Overview
This project implements a complete **end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP)** solution to analyze user reviews of the **ChatGPT application**.  
It leverages a **custom-built Machine Learning pipeline** to classify reviews into **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative** sentiment categories based on the review text.

The final deliverable is an **interactive Streamlit Web Dashboard** that combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of user ratings with **advanced sentiment insights** generated by the trained ML model.

## 💡 Core Innovation: Custom ML Pipeline

### 🧠 Why a Custom Pipeline?
Off-the-shelf sentiment models often fail to capture nuanced, domain-specific language.  
To address this limitation, a **Custom Logistic Regression Pipeline** was designed for **high reliability** on a **small, domain-specific dataset**.

This pipeline (saved via `joblib`) combines two powerful feature extraction methods:

1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**
   - Captures the statistical importance of words and phrases (n-grams).
   - Learns which terms are most relevant to specific sentiment classes.

2. **VADER Lexicon Score**
   - Integrates the pre-trained **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**.
   - Adds a **Compound Polarity Score**, representing the overall emotional tone of each review.

## 💼 Business Value & Use Cases

The **Streamlit Dashboard** offers two main analysis pages, providing clear and actionable business intelligence.

### 1. 🧭 EDA on Ratings
Analyzes traditional 1–5 star user ratings and answers key questions such as:
- What is the distribution of user-given stars?
- How does the average rating vary over time or across app versions?
- Which rating ranges dominate the dataset?

### 2. 🤖 Sentiment Analysis
Delivers deeper, text-based insights from the ML model:
- Which keywords most strongly drive **Negative** sentiment (e.g., *“slow,” “bug,” “paywall”*)?
- Do **verified or premium users** express different sentiments compared to others?
- Is there a mismatch between **numeric ratings** and **text sentiment**?  
  *(Example: a 4-star review with a negative tone.)*

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### ✅ Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Hida-Fathima/sentiment-project


cd sentiment-project


2. Install Dependencies
   
The project uses the following libraries. Install them using the requirements.txt file:


pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Preprocessing & Model Training Script
   
This script loads the raw data, performs cleaning, trains the Custom ML Pipeline on 225 rows (testing on 25), saves the final model (I have uploaded the models in models folder for ref), and creates the processed dataset (custom_ml_analysis_dataset.csv, I have uploaded in the data folder for ref) for the dashboard.

python preprocess_and_train_ml.py


This will output:

✅ data/custom_ml_analysis_dataset.csv (The dashboard source data)

✅ models/custom_ml_model.pkl (The saved ML Pipeline)

✅ models/custom_ml_metrics.json (The model's performance report)

4. Launch the Streamlit Dashboard

   
Start the interactive web application:

streamlit run app.py


The application will automatically open in your web browser, allowing you to explore the EDA, Sentiment Analysis, Model Performance, and Live Analyzer pages.
